My day job is working as a developer in lovely Oslo, Norway. I build some things for fun in my spare time, and share them in the hope that they're useful. Other times I nerd about stationery. Lately I've gotten into running, to the surprise of many â€“Â most of all myself.

If you're also into pens and paper, I share monthly writeups on what I use over at [williamkillerud.com](https://www.williamkillerud.com/blog/)
